## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to Verilog coding practices. Each file corresponds to a specific Verilog code example, ranging from basic constructs to complex digital system designs. Whether you are a beginner learning Verilog or an experienced engineer, this repository provides valuable insights into Verilog programming and digital design.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized in the following manner:


- Each folder is named by the day of the upload (e.g., day1, day2, etc.).
- Inside each folder, there is a Verilog file (`exampleX.v`), which contains the specific code for that day.

## Verilog Code Examples

The Verilog examples provided are related to various topics, such as:

- Basic Verilog Syntax
- Combinational Logic Design
- Sequential Circuits
- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Arithmetic Operations
- Testbenches

Each code example will include a brief explanation at the top, highlighting the main goal and design considerations for that dayâ€™s code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/verilog-coding-repo.git
